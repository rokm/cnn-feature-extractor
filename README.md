# CNN Feature Extractor #

A Matlab class implementing CNN Feature Extractor based on Caffe, as
originally presented by Ross Girschick et al. [1], and adapted for
various computer vision tasks [2].

The code is inspired by the original R-CNN implementation [3], but is
limited to only the feature extractor part. Thus, it offers a flexible
CNN feature extraction pipeline that can be used to extract responses
from desired network's layer (e.g., FC7 for regular feature extraction,
soft-max for final predictions, etc.). Responses can be obtained either
from whole image or one or more specified regions of interest (e.g.,
bounding boxes from region proposals).

While superseded by faster and improved approaches (Fast R-CNN,
Faster R-CNN, etc.), having a minimal flexible CNN feature extraction
pipeline may still prove useful, especially in application of CNN
features in various specialized application domains.

## Installation ##
The project depends on Caffe; for the sake of self-containment, the
appropriate version is bundled as a git submodule. Due to Caffe
dependency, only linux is officially supported right now.

The Caffe should be compiled and installed via CMake; the project expects
to find it installed in external/caffe-bin folder. For convenience, it
includes a build script that compiles and deploys Caffe. The script was
written and used on Fedora linux, so it may or may not work on other
distributions - if you have problems, try to manually execute its steps.

Note that because MatCaffe bindings are dynamically linked against
libcaffe.so, the latter needs to be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH before Matlab
is started.

# Dependencies
Make sure that Caffe dependencies are installed; the list of packages
for Fedora is (assuming [Negativo17's repository](https://negativo17.org/multimedia) is used for CUDA):
```Shell
sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ boost-devel glog-devel gflags-devel \
    protobuf-devel hdf5-devel lmdb-devel leveldb-devel snappy-devel \
    openblas-devel python-devel python2-numpy
sudo dnf install  cuda-devel cudnn-devel cuda-gcc-c++
```
and for Ubuntu:
```Shell
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libboost-all-dev libgflags-dev \
    libgoogle-glog-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libhdf5-dev \
    liblmdb-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopenblas-dev python-dev \
    python-numpy
sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

# Build commands
```Shell
# Checkout the source
git clone https://github.com/rokm/cnn-feature-extractor.git
cd cnn-feature-extractor
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build and deploy dependencies
export MATLABDIR=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2016b
./build_all.sh

# Start Matlab
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/project/external/caffe-bin/lib64
${MATLABDIR}/bin/matlab
```
